**Tool Found:** [ESLint v3.13.1](http://eslint.org/blog/2017/01/eslint-v3.13.1-released)

### Day 12: 29 Jun 2018

Learned about key sequence detection & Konami code. Also, found that [BuzzFeed site](https://www.buzzfeed.com/)'s hidden easter egg is still working. To see it in action just press ':arrow_up: :arrow_up: :arrow_down: :arrow_down: :arrow_left: :arrow_right: :arrow_left: :arrow_right: B A'.

### Day 13: 30 Jun 2018

Learned a bit more about window events & a very useful javascript debounce function. Today's project helped me to fix an issue related to resize events which was slowing down our site. The goal behind debounce implementation is to reduce overhead by preventing a function from being called several times in succession.

### Day 14: 1 Jul 2018

 Learned more about array & object reference vs actual copy. Found that primitive types are manipulated by value & reference types are manipulated by reference. Numbers and booleans are primitive types in JavaScript -- primitive because they consist of nothing more than a small, fixed number of bytes that are easily manipulated at the low (primitive) levels of the JavaScript interpreter. Objects, on the other hand, are reference types. Arrays and functions, which are specialized types of objects, are therefore also reference types. These data types can contain arbitrary numbers of properties or elements, so they cannot be manipulated as easily as fixed-size primitive values can. Since object and array values can become quite large, it doesn't make sense to manipulate these types by value, as this could involve the inefficient copying and comparing of large amounts of memory.

### Day 15: 2 Jul 2018

Learned some useful stuff on local Storage & event delegation.

Completed all of the project goals for today:-

### Day 16: 3 Jul 2018
Today learned about assigning to new variable names using ES6 Object destructuring and how we can update CSS rules like textShadow or anything using javascript. Just like canvas this was a fun challenge today. I tried some css effects like this:-

### Day 17: 4 Jul 2018
Updated code to show modified band names on which sort actually happens and on right side the actual band names. After code modifications it looks like this:-

### Day 18: 5 Jul 2018
Learned more about `Array.prototype.reduce()` and its usability test case scenario. `reduce()` is quite simple & effective in specific scenarios like in the example below:-
